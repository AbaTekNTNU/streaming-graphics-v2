#### GameJanitory.py

The idea behind this script was to constantly scrape the results (showed out to be imposible as the live results page is Client side render (and not ssr as the on demand result page)) and update the score thereafter to always stay in sync. This turned out to be totaly unesesarry.

#### scrape.py

This is only possible for on demand stats, that we don't actually need

#### aggregate.py

Was used with scrape.py that we don't use
